## [Skills]{style="color: #990000"}

-   **Clinical research experience**. As the principal investigator or conjunction-principal investigator I have designed and conducted multiple clinical trials, including three randomized controlled trials, one single-arm trial with Simon's two-stage design, and several case-controlled studies, and cohort studies.

-   **Data analyses**. I am proficient in clinical statistical analysis and multi-omics data analysis, including single-cell sequencing, microbiome, proteomics, transcriptomics, lipidomics, and neuroimaging.

-   **Neural Mechanism Related** **Research**. Employing brain-derived extracellular vesicles (BDEVs) and complementary methodologies, we conducted a series of investigations into the mechanisms underlying depression. Our research encompassed both clinical trials and rodent models.

-   **Development of New Methods**. I have developed a novel method to isolate BDEVs from urine. This non-invasive approach enables daily collection of *in vivo* central nervous system (CNS) signals, significantly increasing sampling frequency compared to traditional methods.

-   **Development of New Therapies**. I have developed Hybrid-ECT and i-HECT, a modified form of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for patients with treatment-resistant  depression  that preserves the therapeutic efficacy of standard ECT while mitigating cognitive side effects.

-   **Brain Imaging**. Earlier, I have analyzed resting-state functional MRI and published a meta-analysis of brain networks based on graph theory.

-   **Experience of manuscript publication and peer-reviewing**. I have authored over 50 papers, the majority of which are published in JCR Q1 and Q2 journals, with some in top-tier publications. I hold first or corresponding authorship on approximately 26 papers (H-index = 13, total citations = 857). Additionally, I have served as a reviewer for more than ten reputable journals worldwide.

## [My Strengths]{style="color: #990000"}

One of my strengths is identifying new research directions from conventional practices and providing simple solutions. Here are two examples:

1.  **New ECT (electroconvulsive therapy) Strategy.** While ECT is the gold standard for treating severe depression for nearly 80 years, its severe cognitive side effects limit its use. I developed a novel protocol, "Hybrid-ECT," where the first three sessions follow conventional ECT, but subsequent sessions use half the electrical dosage, irrespective of seizure induction. In two randomized controlled trials and a Simon's optimal two-stage design single-arm trial, Hybrid-ECT showed efficacy comparable to conventional ECT with significantly milder cognitive side effects. Some patients even showed improved cognitive outcomes compared to baseline levels
2.  **Innovated a Method for Isolating BDEVs** **from Urine:** Since approximately 2013, isolating brain-derived extracellular vesicles (BDEVs) from peripheral blood has provided direct *in vivo* data on the central nervous system (CNS) from human participants, effectively bypassing the blood-brain barrier. This approach, metaphorically referred to as "new windows into the brain", has significantly advanced research on CNS diseases, particularly neurodegenerative disorders. However, daily blood sampling from human subjects is impractical, limiting BDEVs to cross-sectional or low temporal resolution data. Consequently, I shifted my focus to urine. Although omics studies on EVs in urine indicate that most originate from the urogenital tract, I found that proteomics sensitivity might be insufficient to detect the very low abundance of BDEVs in urine. To address this, I developed a method to isolate BDEVs from urine (uBDEVs). Despite uBDEVs constituting only about 1% of the total EVs in urine, this small proportion is adequate for subsequent research. This method enables non-invasive and frequent, even daily, collection of *in vivo* CNS signals, akin to recording a movie rather than taking snapshots of the CNS.

(D–G) TEM images of uTEVs and uADEVs (scale bars: 0.5 μm for D and F, 100 nm for E and G). (H) Results of western blotting: Three EV markers (CD63, CD9 and Alix) and an astrocyte marker (GFAP) were present in the ADEVs sample, while two kidney markers (NKCC2 and NCC) were absent. (I) Immunogold labeled uADEVs with anti-GLAST antibody (the back dots).*

*Fig. 2: The trajectories of GluN1 in uADEVs. Compared to a sex- and age-matched healthy volunteer (light green line with triangles), the dynamic changes in GluN1 in uADEVs of the patient with anti-NMDAR encephalitis (purple line with dots) are relatively larger. At the three-month follow-up visit after discharge, the patient's GluN1 level in uADEVs decreased to a level similar to the healthy volunteer.*

</div>

In my view, the uBDEVs method has the potential to be a game changer, and high-frequency sampling could become a standard protocol in the research of rapidly changing CNS diseases.

I received a Ph.D. in Psychiatry in July 2024. As so many questions remain in this field, I am now motivated to secure a position that will allow me to use my method and other skills to extensively explore neuro-psychiatric disorders. **I am particularly interested in the following aspects of CNS diseases: uncovering new biomarkers, potentially identifying new diseases, elucidating their underlying mechanisms, developing diagnostic tools, and improving treatment strategies**.
